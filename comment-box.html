    <h1>Top 10 Historical Places in Bangladesh</h1>

    <div id="comment-container">
        <p>1. Lalbagh Fort:
            The 17th century Mughal fort which stands by the Buriganga River is one of the oldest architecture of
            Bangladesh. It was built by the then Mughal Subahdar Muhammad Azam Shah, son of Emperor Aurangzeb. It is
            believed that the construction of the fort was never completed.


        </p>
        <p>2. Ahsan Manzil:
            Initially, it was a vacation house for a Zamindar of Jamalpur district, Sheikh Enayet Ullah. After his
            death, his son sold this property to the French traders in 1740. They dug a pond in front of the building
            where fresh water could be fetched. After having a great business in the subcontinent for almost a century,
            they surrendered under the full British power and sold all of their properties. So, in 1830, Khwaja
            Alimullah an established man in Dhaka bought the property. He added a mosque in this compound. After his
            death, his son Khwaja Abdul Gani made some progressive look to the property and named it “Ahsan Manzil”
            after his son Ahsan Ullah.
        </p>

        <p>4. Mahansthangarh:
            This place lies in a village of Bogra district called Mahasthan. Garh means fort, so Mahasthangarh
            means fort of Mahasthan.

            Francis Buchanan Hamilton, a Physician, first discovered this place in 1808. However, he made some
            significant contributions as a Geographer during his stay in Indian subcontinent. It is the last remaining
            piece of a village Pundranagara of that time. The village was alive until the 8th century AD.
